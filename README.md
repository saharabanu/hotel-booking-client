This is hotel booking service project. In this project , I have used Next.js, Ant Design (css framework), and Javascript for Frontend Integration. I have also used Node and Mongoose for backend .It is fully responsive project. In this home page, I have shown some features , for example, filtering, searching, scroll top top button and carousel and etc.I have also created and implemented service details , service page, feedback page, about us page, login and registration page, booking and confirmation page.

I have also implemented admin and user dashboard, user profile.

An Admin can manage all users, services, booking. I have also created small notification.
